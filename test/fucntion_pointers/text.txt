Use Cases for Function Pointers


Callbacks: 
Function pointers are widely used to implement callback mechanisms. For example, they can be passed to algorithms or tools that need to perform certain operations, where the specific operations can vary based on the calling context.


Event Handling: 
In GUI or event-driven programming, function pointers can be used to dynamically determine which functions to call when events occur.


Interfacing with C APIs: 
Many C libraries use function pointers to implement callbacks or to allow users to customize behavior.


Implementing Strategy Patterns: 
Function pointers can be used in place of interfaces to implement strategy patterns, where different algorithms can be swapped dynamically.
